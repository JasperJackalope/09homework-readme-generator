## License

    This project has no license.

## Installation

For this to run properly, you must install Node.js and Inquirer Package v.8.2.4 in the terminal.

## Usage

A user will be presented with a  series of prompts asking questions to fill out the various sections of the README. The user will be asked to input a title, a description, any instillation information, be presented with a list of license options, and finally input their contributors/credits, any tests, and contact information for any questions a user might have.

## Contributing

A big thank you to my friend and tutor Cameron Gibson for always being there to answer questions. Thank you to Bryan and Shawn for their amazing instruction. I used W3 Schools to answer questions along with the occasionaly ChatGPT question.

## Tests

None.
