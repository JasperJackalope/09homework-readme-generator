# Homework 09 - README Generator



## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a README Generator, using JavaScript and Node.js to be able to run in the terminal outside of a web browser. This README was created using the Generator.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## License

    This project has no license.

## Installation

For this to run properly, you must install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download) and Inquirer Package v.8.2.4 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Usage

A user will be presented with a series of prompts asking questions to fill out the various sections of the README. The user will be asked to input a title, a description, any instillation information, be presented with a list of license options, and finally input their contributors/credits, any tests, and contact information. Once each question is answered, a README file will automatically be created.

## Contributing

A big thank you to my friend and tutor Cameron Gibson for always being there to answer questions. Thank you to Bryan and Shawn for their amazing instruction. I used W3 Schools to answer questions along with the occasional ChatGPT question.

## Tests

None.
